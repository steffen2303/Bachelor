nicht von einem gemeinsames Risiko (z.B. Fiber-Cut, Erdbeben) betroffen sind.

    The backbone network is generally a distributed network, while the

    cases, the network may consist primarily of either centralized or
    distributed portions. This paper discusses topological design problems
    for such systems, including the concentrator location problem, the
    terminal assignment problem, the terminal layout problem (the constrained
    minimum spanning tree problem), the distributed network topological
    layout problem, and the backbone node location problem. Recent algorithm
    research, including exact and heuristic problem solutions, are described
    and computational experience is given. Finally, open problems in
    large-scale topological design are reported.},

    evaluate classes of techniques for improving end-to-end service
    availability. Using several large-scale connectivity traces, we
    develop a model of failures that includes key parameters such as
    failure location and failure duration. We then use trace-based
    simulation to evaluate several classes of techniques for coping with
    network failures. We find that caching alone is seldom effective at
    insulating services from failures but that the combination of mobile
    extension code and prefetching can improve failure rates by as much
    as an order of magnitude for classes of service whose semantics
    support disconnected operation. We find that routing-based techniques
    may provide significant improvements, but that the improvements of
    many individual techniques are limited because they do not address
    all significant categories of network failures. By combining the
    techniques we examine, some systems may be able to improve
    availability by as much as one or two orders of magnitude. keywords:
